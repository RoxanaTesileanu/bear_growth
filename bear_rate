Initial steps on the development of a growth rate for brown bear in Romania

Roxana Tesileanu


1ST YEAR: 

Organize a survey in order to gain the necessary data (no. and age-structure of bears in the hunting units across Romania).
Assess the uncertainty of the responses of managers of the hunting units regarding their subjective estimates on the no. and age-structure of bears under their jurisdiction. How can their professionalism be assessed?

Aim: Pinpoint an initial population size (and its error) for the calculation of growth rate.


2ND YEAR:

Assess how the Leslie matrix can be compiled at the national level, event. county level.
And compute the estimated growth rate. 
R package?
