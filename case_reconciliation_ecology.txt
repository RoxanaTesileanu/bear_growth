Letting animals breathe: two cases for reconciliation ecology

- alleviating the human impact in highly affected/degraded ecosystems
- cases:
    - bear in RO => supplemental feeding => destabilized metapopulation => after Oct. 2016, potential diffusion from places of high densities to places of low densities if supplemental feeding is stopped.
    - wolfs in Ba-Wue/D => lack of wild prey => lack of survival chances => a reduction of the cull on deer would potentially create room for the wolf in Ba-Wue/D, together with measures of decreasing its prey on domestic animals.
