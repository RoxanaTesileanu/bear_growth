Scarcity or cornucopia? The open question of the brown bear conservation status in Romania

Abstract

The present public and scientific debate around the management objectives regarding the population of brown bear (Ursus arctos) in Romania polarizes around two main perspectives: there is an endangered decreasing brown bear population which needs absolute protection, and, there is an increasing brown bear population which places the brown bear outside the scope of a strict protection, and even suggests a management of sustainable yield. Unfortunately, neither side presents scientific field evidence which can support policy making.  
At the present time,there is an absolute protection of the brown bear in Romania, only very aggressive individuals being withdrawn from the population after repeated damages. This strict management could have a stabilizing effect on the population of brown bear, if any other artificial factors influencing the true and (unfortunately) unestimated population size would be stopped. The present paper offers a theoretical discussion of the ecological consequences of the in force policy regarding the management of the brown bear in Romania and suggests possible management options in accordance to it.   

Introduction
- one of the biggest challenges: policy-making with no available or scarce data => policy-making under high uncertainty 
- how can it work? 
- necessary because policy-making cannot wait until data are available, decisions are urgent
