Current management relies on estimates of density that lack statistical oversight and ignore uncertainty deriving from track surveys. 
Alternative Approach: Estimate brown bear density using sign surveys along transects within a novel integration of OCCUPANCY MODELS and HOME RANGE methods. 
Estimates bear abundance using unique tracks N-mixture hierarchical models, which account for imperfect detection. Very nice idea! I've wrote a similar proposal last year!
Also they've weighted the results accordingly, as usual, in order to predict abundances for whole areas based on home-ranges.
